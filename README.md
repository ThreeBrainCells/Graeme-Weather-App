This is my attempt at creating a website using a pre-developed API.

The purpose was to use city names (both from local storage and user searches) to get the latitude and longitude via OpenWeatherAPI's Geocoding API (http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct) and then use that for their one-call weather API (https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall) to gather data not only for the current day, but also for a five-day forecast.

This is the result:https://threebraincells.github.io/Graeme-Weather-App/

What the website looks like: [./Assets.Graeme-Weather.png]
